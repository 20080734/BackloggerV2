# BackloggerV2
Kevin Atkins 20080734
Second version of the backlogger app, for android use
Mobile App Development Assignment 2 Made in Android Studio with Kotlin/Gradle

Simple mobile app designed to showcase CRUD functionality.

Backlogger is a simple console app that allows you to keep a list of games as your personal Backlog. Backlogs in general are lists of games/movies etc ( this app is optimised for games ) that you don't have time to enjoy yet, but you wish to try later.

This particular version of Backlogger allows you to Create, Read, Update and Delete new or existing games and add them to the backlog. You can check the info page in the app for some help.

An attempt was made to make individual views of the game entries on the TEST1 branch of this repo. That current version
only allows for READ to work and does not work entirely with CRUD, hence it was left on the TEST1 branch.
